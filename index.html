<p>Scientific plotting and GTK+ have never been good friends. Over the years there have been several attempts like <a href="http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net/cms/">GtkExtra</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkdatabox/">GtkDataBox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/drahnr/goatplot">GoatPlot</a>, <a href="http://gtkgraph.sourceforge.net">GtkGraph</a>, <a href="http://plotmm.sourceforge.net/index.html">Plotmm</a>... All of these packages unfortunately appear to share a lack of development and maintenance, which is most clearly shown by the fact that they do not support the latest release series GTK+3!</p>
<p>Now it is clear that writing a plotting library for GTK+ is a huge and cumbersome task, and the lack of support for GTK+3 can be most certainly explained by the transition of the GTK+ drawing routines to use Cairo instead of GDK, which essentially required developers to rewrite all their code from scratch.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of my scientific work, I found myself in need of scientific plotting widget support in GTK+ and for some time I have been able to do what I needed with GtkExtra. Although certainly not perfect, it comes with a wide range of plotting routines, but as I said before, it only supports GTK+2. In order to address this shortcoming, I have joined the development team some time ago but I found myself lacking the knowledge of the GTK+ and Cairo internals to produce a working version that supports GTK+3.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of attention by the other developers of GtkExtra, I found myself still in need of a scientific plotting widget for GTK+3, so I decided to find a different solution. Since I certainly do not have the skill (or time for that matter) to write an entire class of GTK+ widgets for scientific plotting, I had to find a different approach. The idea that eventually culminated into this project was the following: first I rediscovered the <a href="http://plplot.sourceforge.net">PLplot</a> library, which I had used many years ago to produce simple plots from within command-line programs. I went through their (excellent) documentation and discovered that they had introduced support for a Cairo plotting driver, along with an <code>extcairo</code> device that allowed PLplot to draw onto a Cairo context. An example is included in the source where they demonstrate this feature by plotting onto a Cairo context connected to a PostScript surface. Based on this example I wrote my own Gtkmm widget that inherits from <code>Gtkmm::DrawingArea</code> with a custom <code>on_draw</code> method as explained in the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkDrawingArea.html">GTK+</a> and <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/classGtk_1_1DrawingArea.html">Gtkmm</a> manuals. With surprisingly little work, I managed to produce a nice looking plot.</p>
<p>I followed up with a blogpost <a href="http://tschoonj.github.io/blog/2015/07/05/embedding-plplot-in-gtk-drawingareas/">about this</a> and a couple of days later I decided to start this project after it was clear that it could be useful to myself and my colleages.</p>
<p>I think that the approach followed by Gtkmm-PLplot has the following advantages:</p><ul>
<li>Depends on a mature toolkit (PLplot) to do the bulk of the work. No need for me to write the low-level plotting routines.</li>
<li>Relies on Cairo for rendering, which looks like it will remain the GTK+ workhorse for a long time to come. This means low maintenance.</li>
<li>PLplot itself has a lot of useful features, but suffers (IMHO) from its obscure, often acronym based hard to remember API. Gtkmm-PLplot hides this API and offers an interface that should be familiar to anyone with GTK+/Gtkmm experience.</li>
<li>One of the things that bothers me about GtkExtra is that every time you change a plot or canvas property, you are responsible for calling drawing routines to ensure the widget is updated accordingly. Gtkmm-PLplot does this for you: a property is updated, everything is redrawn immediately. This is done by relying heavily on <a href="http://libsigc.sourceforge.net">libsigc++</a>'s signalling</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be people wondering why I didn't write this in plain C using GTK+ instead of Gtkmm. I acknowledge that this project would benefit from this as it makes the API easily available in other languages through GObject introspection. However, writing GTK+ widgets is a real pain (remember: nobody is maintaining those other plotting widgets...), while writing in C++ produces nice, streamlined and compact code, especially when using the C++11 features. It's also just a lot more fun to do, and that's very important to me :-)</p>
<p>Starting with version 2.0, Gtkmm-PLplot is released under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>.</p>
<p>That's it! Enjoy using Gtkmm-PLplot and let me know if you run into bugs... </p><dl class="section author"><dt>Author</dt><dd>Tom Schoonjans </dd></dl>
