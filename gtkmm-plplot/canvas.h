 *  \brief The namespace provided by Gtkmm-PLplot
 *
 *  Gtkmm-PLplot provides only one namespace, which is used
 *  to contain all of its classes. As it name shows, the namespace
 *  name was chosen on purpose to make it clear that it acts as
 *  an extension of the Gtkmm provided `Gtk` namespace.
 *  When including Gtkmm-PLplot in your code, you will have to
 *  prefix the class names with our namespace, or alternatively,
 *  include `using namespace Gtk::PLplot;` in your file.

     *  \brief Principal plotting widget
     *
     *  Inheriting from `Gtk::DrawingArea`, this is by far the most important
     *  widget in PLplot, as it will contain the plots and the datasets.
     *  Depending on which constructor is chosen, either an empty canvas will be produced, or one containing a single plot.
     *  It is possible however, to add any number of plots on the canvas. The positions and dimensions of these plots are properties of the plots, that have to be provided
     *  when invoking their constructors. This is demonstrated in \ref example3 and \ref example4.
     *  \ref example1 shows how to write a canvas and its contents to a file as well as to send a canvas to a printer
     *  using the draw_plot method.
